# Ledgesmb notes

Questions
- Eric mentioned having to setup reverse proxy to use Apache. How does this work?
- Starman doesn't work with Windows. What's the alternative?
- can Starman and apache coexist on the same server? 

1.5 no longer has setup.pl. Now virtualised. 
Works much more easily (!) With Starman. 

# Setup procedure
Ledgersmb is a web app. Access is via a browser. It supports multiple users with different levels of access according to their requirements. For testing and local use Starman is recommended as the host server. Setup on apache is possible, but more complicated than Starman. For local use on Windows it's easier to set up ledgersmb on a virtual machine running Debian. 

Ledgersmb requires Postgresql. Make sure it's installed on your server before you begin. 
Installing ledgersmb will involve creating several database and app user accounts. 
- postgresql root user
- postgresql ledgersmb user
- ledgersmb superuser 
- ledgersmb admin user
- ledgersmb app user (x the number of actual users)
It's possible to have the same credentials for all these but not recommended as things can become quite confusing. 

Untar into /usr/share * other directories possible, but docs assume that this is the location.
Check postgresql for access. 
Run $$&amp;@$&amp; from command line to check dependencies. 
Run setup.pl (note that this is no longer an actual file on the filesystem.) 
Setup ssl (no idea how to do this, use the new ssl service?:
